## ARM Options ##
#################

# Distinguish UDF video discs from UDF data discs.  Requires mounting disc so adds a few seconds to the identify script.
ARM_CHECK_UDF: true

# When enabled if the disc is a DVD use dvdid to calculate a crc64 and query Windows Media Meta Services for the Movie Title.
# For BluRays attempts to extract the title from an XML file on the disc
GET_VIDEO_TITLE: true

# Skip transcoding if you want the original MakeMKV files as your final output
# This will produce the highest quality videos (and use the most storage)
# Note: RIPMETHOD must be set to "mkv" for this feature to work
# Note: The largest file will be considered to be the "main feature" but there are cases when this is not true
# to avoid losing a desired track, use this feature with an EXTRAS_SUB value that is not "None"
SKIP_TRANSCODE: false

# Video type identification.  Options are "auto", "series", "movie".
# If "auto" then ARM will get the video type when quering the movie webservice.  This is default.
# If the disc is not clearly a movie or series, or if ARM is having difficulty getting the right video type
# you can override the automatic identification with "series" or "movie"
VIDEOTYPE: "auto"

# Minimum length of track for ARM rip (in seconds)
MINLENGTH: "600"

# Maximum length of track for ARM rip (in seconds)
# Use "99999" to indicate no maximum length
MAXLENGTH: "99999"

# Wait for manual identification
MANUAL_WAIT: true

# Wait tie for manual identification (in seconds)
MANUAL_WAIT_TIME: 60

## Do you want to allow Rips of the same disk multiple times
## With this set as false the task will exit if it recongnises the same movie being ripped
## recommended to set to false for series
ALLOW_DUPLICATES: false

# Number of Transcodes that runs at the same time.
# Certain Video cards are limited to how many encodes they can run at the same time.

## MakeMKV Parameters ##
########################

# Method of MakeMKV to use for Blu Ray discs.  Options are "mkv" or "backup".
# backup decrypts the dvd and then copies it to the hard drive.  This allows HandBrake to apply some of it's
# analytical abilities such as the main-feature identification.  This method seems to offer success on bluray
# discs that fail in "mkv" mode. *** NOTE: MakeMKV only supports the backup method on BluRay discs.  ARM does
# not use MakeMKV for DVDs.
RIPMETHOD: "backup"

# MakeMKV Arguments
# MakeMKV Profile used for controlling Audio Track Selection.
# This is the default profile MakeMKV uses for Audio track selection. Updating this file or changing it is considered
# to be advanced usage of MakeMKV. But this will allow users to alternatively tell makemkv to select HD audio tracks and etc.
# MKV_ARGS: "--profile=/opt/arm/default.mmcp.xml"
MKV_ARGS: ""

# Remove the files created by MakeMKV after processing is complete
DELRAWFILES: true

# Automatically download hashed_keys.  This is for UHD ripping only.  You mush have a UHD friendly drive for this to work.
# Check out this post: https://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=16883&sid=93f1db30f6ceb99b494f3f37cd723841 before
# changing this to True

## HandBrake Parameters ##
##########################

# Handbrake preset profile for DVDs
# Execute "HandBrakeCLI -z" to see a list of all presets
HB_PRESET_DVD: "HQ 720p30 Surround"

# Handbrake preset profile for Blurays
# Execute "HandBrakeCLI -z" to see a list of all presets
HB_PRESET_BD: "HQ 1080p30 Surround"

# Extension of the final video file
DEST_EXT: mkv

# Handbrake binary to call
HANDBRAKE_CLI: HandBrakeCLI

# Have HandBrake transcode the main feature only.  BluRay discs must have RIPMETHOD="backup" for this to work.
# If MAINFEATURE is true, blurays will be backed up to the HD and then HandBrake will go to work on the backed up
# files.
# This will require libdvdcss2 be installed.
# NOTE: For the most part, HandBrake correctly identifies the main feature on movie DVD's, although it is not perfect.
# However, it does not handle tv shows well at all.  This setting is only used when the video is identified as a movie.
MAINFEATURE: false

# Additional HandBrake arguments for DVDs.
HB_ARGS_DVD: "--subtitle scan -F"

# Additional Handbrake arguments for Bluray Discs.
